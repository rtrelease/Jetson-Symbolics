# Jetson-Symbolics
_Adding Symbolic Programming Tools to the Jetson GPU DNN Environment_

AI Lab Notes
 1. Adding symbolic AI programming to Jetson deep neural network development systems
 2. Making symbolic AI progamming (and other things) *go-faster* on Jetsons** with *GraalVM*, its LLVM, polyglot languages resources, and GPUs
